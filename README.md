# Yet Another Particle Editor

![alt text](https://github.com/peppincsoda/particles-demo/raw/master/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

This is a particle editor application to demonstrate the following concepts:

* Recursive descent parsing
* Reverse Polish notation
* How to create custom bytecode
* The visitor design pattern

* How to use OpenGL with Qt5
* The billboarding technique for particles

* An abstract property system connected to Qt5 Model/View classes
* etc.

It is a complex example I used for discussions with colleagues about software design options.

Neither the editor nor the engine is intented to be used in production software
(it doesn't have many features and it's CPU bound, modern engines use the GPU),
rather than to give inspiration to other developers.
Nevertheless it is licensed under the MIT license so you can freely use it.

Enjoy!
